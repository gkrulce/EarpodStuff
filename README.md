# Intensity

Intensity is an Android application that uses the power of machine learning to bring the full functionality of Apple
Earpods to Android devices.

# Motivation

I have a pair of Apple Earpods that I from an iPod I bought years ago and they work perfectly with my Android phone
except the volume controls don't work. This is an incredibly common and frustrating problem to have because iPods are
the most successfuly music player in history while Android phones are the most successful smart phone in history.
