First attempt (9/8/16) 
    2050 features (The absolute value of each frequency with it's real and complex parts). Trained on dataset of 150
    audio files each of which is 2048 samples long. Fed all data into a single training round since it was pretty small.
    I'm having a lot of problems with over fitting since this is a teeny tiny data set.
    The accuracy of the model fluctuates a lot between rounds and is heavily dependent on the split of training data and
    testing data. As a result, I ran ran training 100 times. Median was .33 but mean was .39. 
    The model sucks, but I guess it's doing a bit better than average?
    
    Update: Able to get 100% accuracy by decreasing the learning rate to .01. It still over-fits, but that's a pretty easy
    problem to fix.

A couple more (9/14/16)
    I was getting ~.90 accuracy with training, but the same model would get close to 0% with actual data. I guessed that
    this was because I was using every frequency as a feature and this poorly generalizes to different microphones. As a
    result, I tweaked the bucketSize_ parameter and was able to get similar accuracy with much fewer features that
    generalizes across devices.
    1103 buckets: .88
    58 buckets: .88
    38 buckets: .87
    19 buckets: .86
    I'll do better feature selection so that this model can generalize across devices.
