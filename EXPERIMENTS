First attempt (9/8/16) 
    2050 features (The absolute value of each frequency with it's real and complex parts). Trained on dataset of 150
    audio files each of which is 2048 samples long. Fed all data into a single training round since it was pretty small.
    I'm having a lot of problems with over fitting since this is a teeny tiny data set.
    The accuracy of the model fluctuates a lot between rounds and is heavily dependent on the split of training data and
    testing data. As a result, I ran ran training 100 times. Median was .33 but mean was .39. 
    The model sucks, but I guess it's doing a bit better than average?
